The code automates the compilation of hourly readings from four units of a power plant across the years 2010 to 2023. 
It handles different file formats (XLS for earlier years and XLSX for later years) and merges data from multiple sheets into a unified DataFrame. 
Each day's data consists of 24 hourly rows and 49 columns. 
The code processes each file, extracts and formats relevant data, to compile a comprehensive dataset.
The final DataFrame is validated and exported to an Excel file for further analysis.
